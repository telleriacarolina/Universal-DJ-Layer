# Universal-DJ-Layer
The DJ Control Layer is a universal, pluggable system that enables safe collaboration, real-time experimentation, and role-based tuning in any host app. Modular “discs” allow reversible changes while preserving core logic, purpose, security, and creator ownership, with full auditing and observability.
